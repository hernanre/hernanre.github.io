  <p>Welcome! I am Ricardo Elias Hernandez. Above, is me when I try and let my facial hair grow. I am a junior Computer Science major at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. I am a student worker at the Center for Global Engagement, currently serving as their social media coordinator and also have been or actively members of 
    groups on campus such as Student Government Association, Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, RoseBUD (Rose Building University Diversity), and ESCALATE. 
  <p>I am from Merrillville, IN and come from a really big family, whom I love immensely. I am the youngest of my three siblings, so special treatment was acquired. I am the proud father of three feline babies: Zoi, Zia, and Theodore.</p></p>
  <p>I think its a good idea if we get to know eachother more! Some of my favorite things to do are binge Netflix show's I missed during the academic quarter being a student, learning how to cook new and authentic foods,
     horror films, and anything spicy; especially HOT CHEETOS! I also really enjoy watching tech reviews, leading to me buying a lot of tech that I don't need but want because their Apple products.</p>
